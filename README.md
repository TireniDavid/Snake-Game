# **Temporary Antivirus Disable Instructions**

**Important**: Disabling your antivirus software is a security-sensitive action and should only be done when you are certain that the file you are dealing with is safe and comes from a trusted source. Always re-enable your antivirus after completing the task.

## Why Disable Antivirus?

Sometimes, when downloading or running certain files, your antivirus software may mistakenly flag them as potential threats (false positives). In such cases, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus to complete your task without interference.
Please follow these instructions carefully:

## Windows Defender Antivirus (Windows 10/11)

1. Open Windows Security:
   - In Windows 10: Click the Windows Start button, then select "Settings" (the gear icon). In the Settings window, select "Update & Security," and then choose "Windows Security" from the sidebar.
   - In Windows 11: Click the Windows Start button, then select the "Settings" (gear) icon. In the Settings window, select "Privacy & Security," and then choose "Windows Security."

2. In the Windows Security window, click on "Virus & threat protection."

3. Under the "Virus & threat protection settings" section, click on "Manage settings."

4. Toggle off the "Real-time protection" switch to temporarily disable Windows Defender Antivirus.

Please ensure you only disable real-time protection when you are certain the file is safe. Re-enable your antivirus protection as soon as you have completed your task.

## Browser Security Settings

Some web browsers have built-in security settings that may block downloads or the running of certain file types. If you encounter issues with your browser, you can check and adjust your browser's security settings. Always exercise caution and trust the source of the file.

## Caution
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out for assistance.

Thank you for taking these necessary precautions to ensure the security of your system.
